Student Enrollment Form
# Description
In this I have created a form for Student enrollment in which i have create some fields like roll no. full name , class, date of birth, address and enrollment date.
I made the rollno as primary key and type of input is number and for date of birth, enrollment date the type is date so that we can take date from the calender.
It has three buttons named as Save, Change and Reset so, initially all three buttons are disabled. When the focus is on roll no. and it is not in the record then it will enablesave and reset button. And if roll no. is find the it will enable change and reset button and the roll no. field is disabled.
